    Our Products
We have developed both a cream and an oil, which can be used separately, or together for maximum effect. Our cream is a luxurious mixture of vegetable oils and waxes, water, essential oils and a gentle preservative. The cream should be applied two to three times daily, or as required. Our oil consists of vegetable and vitamin e oils, and essential oils for scent and therapeutic effect. The oil is great for scalp application, and for application on the body underneath the cream. Many users report great results from using the oil after the bath or shower, and leaving overnight.
