    At Science for Skin, we have developed several products to help relieve the symptoms of dry, irritated skin types. Johanne holds a PHD in chemistry, and James a BSc in Bioscience and an HND in beauty therapy science. Together we have devised a formulation based on existing scientific research in the field. Aware of the sensitive nature of these conditions, we have based our formulation on natural, additive free ingredients. 
    We have researched current products for such dry and have found the market to be lacking in an effective, science based solution, that is free from the irritants which can worsen irritated skin.
